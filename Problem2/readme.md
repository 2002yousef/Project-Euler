# Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be: $$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$  
The program checks if the new term is even then adds it to the variable sum.

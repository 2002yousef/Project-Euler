# Sum Square Difference
This is a python algorithm, which computes the square of sum of the first n positive integers and subtracts from it the sum of the first n squares

## Explanation and Formulae
1. Sum of squares: $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

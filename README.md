# Project-Euler
This project is a collection of solutions to the problems found on Project Euler, a website that presents a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems. Each problem is solved using Python programming language and is organized in separate folders for better readability and organization.

## Installation
To use the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The code is compatible with Python 3.x versions.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-euler-solutions.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```
cd Project-Euler
```

## Usage
Each problem solution is contained within its own folder, named after the problem number. To execute a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the Python file associated with the problem.

For example, to run the solution for Problem 1, navigate to the Problem1 folder and execute the P1.py file:
```
cd Problem1
python P1.py
```
